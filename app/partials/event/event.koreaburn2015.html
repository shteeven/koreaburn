      <h3>  2014 Theme – Elements</h3>
      <h4>Elements</h4>
      <p>
        Elements, theme of this year, means the basic parts or principles of things. KOREA BURN 2014 will use a new layout for dividing the sectors, which is inspired by Korea flag. Each symbol on the flag represents an element: earth, air, water, or fire. We want to encourage people to bring their own elements in there. Someone could make music as his or her way to express air. Someone might make huge sculpture that visualize the air. Everybody has their own unique element, and it can be brought by various ways. KOREA BURN 2014 will be the space and time for the unique elements with style brought by burners.

      <h4>What is KOREA BURN?</h4>
      <p>
        KOREA BURN  is an official regional burn event of Burning Man.
      </p>
      <p>
        KOREA BURN started in 2011 on Muuido Beach, near Incheon, in South Korea. With roughly 150 burners in attendance, people set up tents, played guitars and bongos while everyone participated in body painting, hair braiding, yoga, dancing, bar-tending, and fire-spinning!
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to bring the spirit and community of Burning Man in Nevada, USA, to South Korea, with all the love and creative expression of Black Rock City.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real Burning Man is a celebration of community with its gifting society where everything is given without expectations of a return gift or payment. The community is open to all people and invites everyone to bring a piece of themselves to add to the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        Burning Man is a celebration of the individual with its freedom to expression. All are free to show their true colors because when you walk onto the playa or the festival, you are home.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope to make KOREA BURN a popular and annual event. With your help and enthusiasm, we can make an event that will rock the Korean peninsula. So, fellow burner, what can you do to add to the community of KOREA BURN?

      <h4>What is Burning Man?</h4>
      <p>
        Trying to explain what Burning Man is to someone who has never been to the event is a bit like trying to explain what a particular color looks like to someone who is blind. In this section you will find the peripheral definitions of what the event is as a whole, but to truly understand this event, one must participate. This site serves to try to paint a picture of the Burning Man experience to those who are new to the project, as well as to give those participants looking to keep the fire burning in their daily lives an environment in which to connect to their fellow community members. For a brief yet eloquent overview of the entire event from the time of arrival to the time of exodus, please read “What is Burning Man?“, an essay written by participant and one-time web team member, Molly Steenson. Please see archived sections for each year to read more about the art themes, art installations and theme camps for each year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you will find links that will take you on a trip through the past – through the history of Burning Man – from its early days on a small beach in San Francisco through its evolution into the bustling city of some 48,000+ people that the Burning Man event has become today. These people make the journey to the Black Rock Desert for one week out of the year to be part of an experimental community, which challenges its members to express themselves and rely on themselves to a degree that is not normally encountered in one’s day-to-day life. The result of this experiment is Black Rock City, home to the Burning Man event.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no rules about how one must behave or express oneself at this event (save the rules that serve to protect the health, safety, and experience of the community at large); rather, it is up to each participant to decide how they will contribute and what they will give to this community. The event takes place on an ancient lakebed, known as the playa. By the time the event is completed and the volunteers leave, sometimes nearly a month after the event has ended, there will be no trace of the city that was, for a short time, the most populous town in the entire county. Art is an unavoidable part of this experience, and in fact, is such a part of the experience that Larry Harvey, founder of the Burning Man project, gives a theme to each year, to encourage a common bond to help tie each individual’s contribution together in a meaningful way. Participants are encouraged to find a way to help make the theme come alive, whether it is through a large-scale art installation, a theme camp, gifts brought to be given to other individuals, costumes, or any other medium that one comes up with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Burning Man project has grown from a small group of people gathering spontaneously to a community of over 48,000 people. It is impossible to truly understand the event as it is now without understanding how it has evolved. See the first years page and Burning Man 1986 – 1996 for the legendary story of Burning Man’s beginnings and to understand how the event has come to become what it is today. The timeline gives a short overview of what each year looked like. Please also check out the detailed archives for years, 1997 to last year. Within each of these years are descriptions each year’s art theme, theme camps, large art installations, as well as maps, journals of our city being built, the newsletters to the community for each year, issues of the Black Rock Gazette (a daily news publication produced and printed on the playa), and clean up reports for each year, including a list of those sites that failed to “leave no trace”. These pages help understand the larger scope of the entire experience, from the planning that happens year-round to make each event possible, to the clean-up efforts which take place for sometimes months after the city has disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact of the Burning Man experience has been so profound that a culture has formed around it. This culture pushes the limits of Burning Man and has led to people banding together nation-wide, and putting on their own events, in attempt to rekindle that magic feeling that only being part of this community can provide. The Black Rock Arts Foundationpromotes interactive art by supporting public art that exists outside the event, and has a special interest in supporting art at regional events. Additionally, Burning Man has over two thousand volunteers who work before, during and after the event (many who work year-round) to make the event a reality. To give of your time and talents, please see theParticipate section of the website.

        If this is your first visit to this site, a good starting point is the FAQ page, the glossary, and the timeline. From here you can stroll through the carefully archived sections for each year. Community, participation, self-expression, self-reliance; these tenets of Burning Man are lifeblood of the Burning Man experience. Whether you are new to this site or are returning for your umpteenth visit, you are encouraged to delve into these pages to expand your viewpoint and definition of these ideals, and to connect with yourself to find your niche in our community. The giving of yourself is the greatest gift you can give to the Burning Man community, and is imperative to the survival of this unique experiment.

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to produce the annual event known as “Burning Man” and to guide, nurture and protect the more permanent community created by its culture. Our intention is to generate society that connects each individual to his or her creative powers, to participation in community, to the larger realm of civic life, and to the even greater world of nature that exists beyond society. We believe that the experience of KOREA BURN can produce positive spiritual change in the world. To this end, it is equally important that we communicate with one another. KOREA BURN is radically inclusive, and its meaning is potentially accessible to anyone. The touchstone of value in our culture will always be immediacy: experience before theory, moral relationships before politics, survival before services, roles before jobs, embodied ritual before symbolism, work before vested interest, participant support before sponsorship. Finally, in order to accomplish these ends, KOREA BURN must endure as a self-supporting enterprise that is capable of sustaining the lives of those who dedicate themselves to its work. From this devotion spring those duties that we owe to one another. We will always burn the Men.
